[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/Ishe27-ops/ishe1package.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Ishe27-ops/ishe1package)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ishe1package is to provide functionality for my package. These 
  functions are for use only with Ishe and no other people.

## Installation

You can install the released version of ishe1package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ishe1package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ishe1package)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
